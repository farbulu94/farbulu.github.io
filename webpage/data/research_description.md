My main research interest is the dynamics of <em>minimal Cantor systems</em>.
This is a wide class of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) that includes odometers, (minimal) substitution subshifts, Toeplitz subshifts, S-adic subshifts and symbolic codings of systems of geometric nature like interval exchange transformations and linear involutions.

<!-- Properties of interest in this class are (topological and measurable) eigenvalues, (strong and weak) mixing and (strong and weak) orbit equivalence classes.

The main strategy in the study of minimal Cantor systems is to obtain sequences of nested <em>Kakutani–Rokhlin partitions</em>.
This allows the original dynamics of the system to be translated in the dynamics defined on a Bratteli diagram, obtaining what is called a <em>Bratteli–Vershik representation</em>.
