My main research interest is the dynamics of <em>minimal Cantor systems</em>.
This is a broad class of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system) that includes odometers, minimal substitution subshifts, Toeplitz subshifts, \\(\mathcal{S}\\)-adic subshifts and symbolic codings of systems of geometric nature like interval exchange transformations and linear involutions.
